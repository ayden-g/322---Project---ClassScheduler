* User Story 02 - User Login
* User Story 03 - Account Creation
* User Story 04 - Course Editing
* User Story 05 - Student Account Functionality


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For sprint 2, I wanted to improve from what was delivered at the end of sprint 1. So I focused on improving the user stories in their implementation. As well I wanted to get the overall UI and Sql database working for the project which I was successful in.
I wanted to get the program in a state that was 'working' that is, it was functional enough to use and functioned according to the user stories inside the kanban board. The major thing about this sprint was sort of being forced to redo all of sprint 1, and 
basically all of sprint 2 by myslef due to my teamates preformances. But from that I think I learned a lot about SQL and UI creation because of that, and I have done a lot of reflecting about going into sprint 3 how to improve my teams overall preformance.

## Unfinished Work
Because I had to reconfigure and create the program solo, the only thing I was not able to get done was User story 6 - Admin functionality. Although most of the code for this is already there in the form of the create and edit courses

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * I think I did pretty well on the solo work, and delivered something that I thought was a good product for sprint 2.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Overall coordination for the group and the project
   * Scheduling for the group
   * Overall time management
   * Code documentation and implementation
   * Overall Communication
   * Teamwork
   * Work quality
   * Participation
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Regular group meetings where the group can discuss issues and coordination. As well as review and improve the code and the project
   * Improving communication and coordination for the group in terms of assigned tasks and expectations.
   * Better use of tools surrounding the project (GitHub, especially)
   * Overall coordination, mostly alerting teamates to progress on individual tasks, or any problems or issues they need help on at the time.
   * Expectations that each of us hold, that being delivering quality work on time, holding oursleves and our teammates to these standards.
