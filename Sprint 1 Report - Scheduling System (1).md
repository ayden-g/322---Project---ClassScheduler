## What's New (User Facing)
* User Story 01 - Course Creation
* User Story 02 - User Login
* User Story 03 - Account Creation

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For sprint 1, our team was able to implement user story 1-3 as we planned for our iterative model. These user stories were implemented in this way so our group could produce a functional application, to demonstrate our vision on how the project would function. As well as a springboard to launch off going into sprints 2 and 3, as these user stories were the bare minimum for our project to function as intended. What we took away from this was teamwork in regards to the implementation of our user stories into the greater project. In that our group came to the conclusion that we were going to need a greater effort in coordination to effectively implement the project to our visions fullest extent.

## Unfinished Work
Our user stories were implemented to the fullest extent we could for this initial working project. Anything that could not be implemented fully is because we have not implemented the SQL database into the project as of sprint 1.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Code review was quick and coordinated
  * We were able to get our user stories written and built
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Overall coordination for the group and the project
   * Scheduling for the group
   * Overall time management
   * Code documentation and implementation
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Regular group meetings where the group can discuss issues and coordination. As well as review and improve the code and the project
   * Improving communication and coordination for the group in terms of assigned tasks and expectations.
